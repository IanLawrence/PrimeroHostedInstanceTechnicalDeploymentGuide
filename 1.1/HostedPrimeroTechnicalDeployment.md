This is a snapshot of the deployment document. The latest and greatest
is maintained along with the Primero source under
primero/doc/chef_deploy.md

Requirements
------------

-   A machine to which you have ssh access

-   A user on that machine that has passwordless sudo access for the `/usr/bin/chef-solo` command so that you don't have to login as root (the machine doesn't need to have chef-solo actually installed yet)

-   Ruby 1.9.3 or higher, Berkshelf 3.2.1 and knife-solo 0.4.2 installed on your local machine (the machine which will launch the deploy)

-   The Primero repository checked out

-   An SSL certificate and key for the application

-   An SSL certificate and key for CouchDB (for syncing over the internet)

-   A JSON attribute node file that corresponds to the node being deployed

To install Berkshelf and Knife-solo on your local machine, you need a
working Ruby environment. Then you can run:

```bash
    $ gem install berkshelf --version 3.2.1
    $ gem install knife-solo --version 0.4.2
```

Try and run this as your normal user. If you get permission errors you
will have to run the gem install command as root.

### Application SSL

To get the application SSL cert, you must go through a recognized
Certificate Authority (CA) or a CA which is trusted by the browsers of
the primary users of this Primero deployment. It is currently not
possible to run Primero except through HTTPS, nor is it advisable to run
any part of Primero except under HTTPS.

### CouchDB SSL

The CouchDB SSL cert uses a private CA whose root certificate is
distributed automatically to all of the servers to verify communication.
To generate a new key and cert, follow the next steps.

#### **Initial Setup**

To setup a new root Certificate Authority to sign CouchDB certs, you
need to configure your machine as your own certificate authority (CA).
Create the next directories and files to save the certificates and keys.
You may need to do it as sudo.

```bash
    $ mkdir /etc/pki/CA
    $ cd /etc/pki/CA
    $ mkdir certs crl newcerts private
    $ chmod 700 private
    $ touch index.txt
    $ echo 1000 > serial
    $ gem install knife-solo --version 0.4.2
```

Also it is necessary to create a root key and a root certificate, that
identifies the certificate authority. To generate the root key with the
proper encryption:

```bash
    $ sudo openssl genrsa -aes256 -out /etc/pki/CA/private/couch_ca.key 4096

    Enter pass phrase **for** ca.key.pem: secretpassword
    Verifying - Enter pass phrase **for** ca.key.pem: secretpassword

    $ sudo chmod 400 /etc/pki/CA/private/couch_ca.key
```

Open the file `/ect/ssl/openssl.cnf` Change the field `dir = /etc/pki/CA`
on [ CA_default ]. Also make sure the following fields look like
this:


```bash

    [ usr_cert ]
    # These extensions are added when 'ca' signs a request.
    basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
    keyUsage = nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
    nsComment = "OpenSSL Generated Certificate"
    subjectKeyIdentifier=hash
    authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer

    [ v3_ca ]
    # Extensions for a typical CA
    subjectKeyIdentifier=hash
    authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid:always,issuer
    basicConstraints = CA:true
    keyUsage = cRLSign, keyCertSign
```

To generate the root certificate:

```bash
    $ sudo openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key /etc/pki/CA/private/couch_ca.key -sha256 -extensions v3_ca -out /etc/pki/CA/certs/couch_ca.cert
    $ sudo chmod 444 /etc/pki/CA/certs/ca.cert.pem
```

You should set up your own `config.cnf` file based on your organization's
policy and contact information. See the openssl docs for more info on
how to configure things.

#### **Creating and Signing New Certs**

Once you have a CA set up, you can make new keys and certs for
individual CouchDB instances. Go to the root directory of your CA.

To create a new key:

```bash
    openssl genrsa -out < HOST_NAME>.key 2048
```

To create a Certificate Signing Request with a key:

```bash
    openssl req -new -key <HOST_NAME>.key -out <HOST_NAME>.csr -config config.cnf
```

To sign the CSR and make a Cert using the root CA key:

```bash
    openssl ca -in <HOST_NAME>.csr -config config.cnf
```

All clients using HTTPS must have trust the root cert in the file
couch_ca.crt.

You must configure the node file (see below) to provision this new CA
certificate onto the deployed server so that it can verify remote
connections upon replication. You can either overwrite the file
`cookbook/files/couch_ca.crt` with your own root cert or you can move the
cert into another file in that directory and set the
primero.couchdb.root_ca_cert_source attribute in the node file to
point to that new file. See below for more information on this
attribute.

### Node File

Next you will need a node file: a JSON file that defines various
deployment attributes. You can copy the file dev-node.json in the root
of this repo for a reference to a more or less complete node file for
Primero. You can put the node file anywhere you like on your system.

#### **Attributes**

The following attributes are of special interest for configuration:

-   primero.server_hostname (required): The DNS hostname of the server. The site should be accessed with this host name.

-   `primero.git.revision` (default: master): The commit id/tag/branch name to deploy

-   `primero.deploy_key` (required): An ssh private key that is configured in the Quoin bitbucket repo (under deployment keys) to allow read-only access to the code

-   `primero.couchdb.password` (required): The CouchDB password for the admin user--this will replace any existing password

-   `primero.couchdb.ssl.cert` (required): The CouchDB SSL certificate, formatted to replace all newlines with '\n'

-   `primero.couchdb.ssl.key` (required): The CouchDB SSL secret key, formatted to replace all newlines with '\n'

-   `primero.ssl.cert` (required): The app SSL certificate, formatted to replace all newlines with '\n'--the hostname in this cert should match the primero.server_hostname value.

-   `primero.ssl.key` (required): The app SSL secret key, formatted to replace all newlines with '\n'

-   `primero.couchdb.root_ca_cert_source` (default: couch_ca.crt): The source path of the Couch CA certificate that is used to verify other CouchDB instances when syncing. This is a path is relative to the files/default directory in this repo. You should add the CA cert there.

You set them by specifying them in JSON in the node file. For example,
if you want to set the hostname to *example.com*, just put the following
in your node file:

```bash
{
  "primero": {
    ... other attibutes ...
    "server_hostname": "example.com",
    ... other attibutes ...
  },
  "run_list": [ "recipe[primero::default]" ]
}

````
#### **Runlist**

You should set your runlist to [ "recipe[primero::default]" ] for
any standard deploy.

Deployment
----------

Once you have the requirements installed, you can run the following two
commands from the cookbook folder of the repo (cookbook directory must
be able to be read by other users):

```bash
    $ ssh USER@APP_HOST 'which chef-solo' || knife solo prepare --bootstrap-version=11.10.4 USER@APP_HOST
    $ knife solo cook USER@APP_HOST NODE_FILE
 ```

Replacing USER with the remote user, APP_HOST with the remote machine
host, and NODE_FILE with the Chef node json file to use for this
deploy. It will take a few minutes to run to completion.

Ports and Firewalls
-------------------

The main Primero application is just like any other HTTPS enabled web
application and runs on ports 80 and 443 for HTTP and HTTPS,
respectively. The application server forces the use client to the HTTPS
port immediately upon the first request, so port 80 should be accessible
to reduce confusion of the users who manually type the URL into the
browser.

If you want to be able to sync the CouchDB data between servers, you
need to open port 6984 on the target server of the replication
configuration. The server that is initiating the sync does not require
the CouchDB port to be open.

For debugging and test purposes, you may also wish to expose the CouchDB
HTTPS port (6984) and/or the Solr Admin port (8983). The Solr admin
should never be exposed to the entire internet under any circumstances,
as it contains sensitive data. If you must expose it in your firewall,
restrict the source IP to one that you control.

### Roving Instances

The roving field instances of Primero have similar firewall/port
requires to the above, except that you will be using the Windows
firewall combined with Virtualbox's port forwarding settings. When you
first installed Primero on Windows, it should have prompted you to
approve a Windows Firewall rule to expose port 11443 (or something
similar). If you approved this, Primero is accessible on at least your
local network through that port.

There are other ports that forwarded from the VM, but they are only
bound to localhost on the Windows host, so they will not be accessible
on the local network no matter what the Windows firewall settings.

If you are syncing between a roving Primero instance and a central
Primero instance, the central Primero instance's database must be
exposed (port 6984). Then, you can set up the sync config on the roving
instance, pointing to the central server as the target.

### Hosted Instances

On hosted instance of Primero, there could be a wide variety of
potential firewall solutions available. If it is hosted on a cloud
environment like AWS or Azure, those services provide firewall
configuration in the management consoles.

In the absence of any simple cloud firewall configuration, you could
configure [UFW](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall) on the
same machine as the application. This will configure the machine's
packet filtering system for you and is fairly easy to use.
